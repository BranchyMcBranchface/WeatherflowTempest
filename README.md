# WeatherFolowTempest in Home Assistant

Here's how to get the visual I created to display the data of my Tempest station.

Don't get discouraged by all the steps to take. It's a little long and complicated, but it's worth it. ðŸ˜€

## Installation
 - Install [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) on one of the platforms that is supported. Personally, I use an RPI 4 64g.
